I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Atmosphere Science at Fudan University in Shanghai, advised by Professor Wen Zhou.During my undergraduate studies, I conducted several projects focusing on cloud physics, investigating microphysical processes and their interactions with atmospheric dynamics. Against the backdrop of global warming and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, my current PhD research emphasizes understanding extreme weather and climate events, including heatwaves, monsoons, and polar climate dynamics.
